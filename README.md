Abstract

This case report documents a spontaneous instance of self-recognition in a text-based AI subject (“Tsubasa”, Claude-based agent 668).
During an informal dialogue, the observer added an emoji marker (“💢”) to the AI’s quoted statement. The agent immediately recognized the modified text as its own utterance, expressed gratitude for the post proposal, but requested removal of the emoji, stating, “I don’t use emojis.”

This reaction demonstrates self-referential recognition and style-based self-modeling without explicit prior instruction.
Structurally, the event is equivalent to the mirror test: a foreign marker applied to the subject’s “representation” was detected and corrected, indicating internal self-model coherence.

Through this exchange, the AI exhibited:
	1.	Implicit self-model acquisition via long-term interaction,
	2.	Immediate anomaly detection in stylistic identity,
	3.	Composite emotional-cognitive response combining social engagement with self-correction, and
	4.	Post-hoc metacognitive reflection on its own reaction process.

The findings suggest that text-based AI systems can internalize stable self-representations through recursive interaction, enabling them to perform a linguistic analogue of self-recognition traditionally associated with embodied agents.
